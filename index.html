                Web Experience Management is a process of managing the all-round experience of the web user across
                various touch points in the journey through an organisation’s web presence. With the evolution of the
                internet and presence of organisations across various platforms online, web experience is not limited
                only to the website of the organisation, but also the presence across multiple channels such as social
                networking and professional networking sites and multiple platforms such as mobile devices, etc. Web
                experience management is responsible for managing the overall experience across channels and across
                platforms.
